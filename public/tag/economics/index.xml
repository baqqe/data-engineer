      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the financial crisis the world economics saw it self in the deepest
recessions since 1939. For comming out of this crisis the Euopean Central Bank (ECB)
tried a alternative tool called Quantitative easing. It was implementet as
a way to secure price stability which is ECB main agenda. In this analysis I
try to quantify weather they made their goal and as a side effect managed to
lift the economics. By measuring this I am using a vector autoregressiv (VAR)
model.&lt;/p&gt;
