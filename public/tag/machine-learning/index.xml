      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Ørsted we had a problem with cargoes comming from around the word to
Amagerværket. The cargoes could either carry Wood Pellets or Wood Chips. It
was every important for the team to know what each cargo were carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For solving this problem I found data from scraping the net and made a Machine
Learning model that classified each cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
